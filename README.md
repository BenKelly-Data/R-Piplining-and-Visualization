# MAPLE Lab Projects
Here is an archive of my final data pipelining and visualization code working under the Emotional Piano Project for the lab.

I followed the labs coding standards and wrote comments in a way that incoming students could understand what they were running.
If you download the Bach data and source the two plot scipts along with Association rules, you can try some of the visualizations yourself in the Practical Use script!

The mergeFunctions code is just a highlight of all the work/code that went in to cleaning and consolidating years of data while staying robust to incoming data and updates.

For examples of some of the outputs:

I presented some Association Rules Analysis at the 2021 Future Directions of Music Cognition: https://osf.io/38dky/

An early verions of the Stack Bar Plots can be found [here.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-o-kelly/detail/treasury/position:1620496404/?entityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profileTreasuryMedia%3A(ACoAADDUddYBFasAcWRaHOnYMp5Rusju38FfIdQ%2C1635465392846)&section=position%3A1620496404&treasuryCount=2) 

BachTrial.csv is a subset of our whole data set just for one experiment we ran with pieces by Bach. The team is currently collecting data for our 6th or 7th composer, and we've run many iterations of each experiment so you can imagine how relatively large the data will get. 

We're hoping to publish visualizations from the Cue Plots and  byParticipant Stacked bar plots in the near future so I will highlight that when it comes out!

Please don't hesitate to reach out with any problems you have with the code or any questions!
